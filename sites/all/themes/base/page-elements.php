		<h1>What We Do</h1>
		<h2>Cambridge Street Ventures believes in those who <span>believe in themselves.</span></h2>
		<p>We can give you a much lengthier explanation, and we will, but if we had to boil it down—that’s it.</p>
		<p>Notice that the words "business" or "investment" or "incubator" appear nowhere in the previous in that statement. It’s because true success is built on more than just a solid business plan.</p>
		<p>It’s this foundational approach and outlook on the importance of an entrepreneur’s true priorities that sets CSV apart.</p>
