					<h1>What We Do</h1>
					<h2>Cambridge Street Ventures believes in those who <br ><span>believe in themselves.</span></h2>
					<p>We can give you a much lengthier explanation, and we will, but if we had to boil it down—that’s it.</p>
					<p>Notice that the words "business" or "investment" or "incubator" appear nowhere in the previous in that statement. It’s because true success is built on more than just a solid business plan.</p>
					<p>It’s this foundational approach and outlook on the importance of an entrepreneur’s true priorities that sets CSV apart.</p>

					<p>Holding a Doctorate in Engineering from MIT, he’s a subject-matter expert whose publications have been cited over 1100 times. A Lt.

					<p>Throughout his career, Wynn has had an uncanny ability to identify both larger opportunities and individual potential. This has led to a systemic championing of great achievement for his teams. He empowers people by bringing out the very best parts of themselves.</p>
					<p>In short, <span>The Colonel is a badass.</span></p>
